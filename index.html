                    As one of the few -- true -- Colorado natives out there, I'm proud to say that I was born in the heart of downtown Denver and would spend my formative years growing up in different parts of the state.
                    After Graduating High School, I decided to enroll in my local community college to pursue an interest in mathematics that I gained while in my K-12 education.
                    It was during my time at Front Range that I saw and began to appreciate the overlap between Math and Computer Science, and decided to pursue degrees in both.
                    After two years of introductory study, I transfered to the Metropolitan State University of Denver (MSU Denver) and earned joint Bachelor's degrees, graduating in 2023.
                    Then, because I'm a glutton for punishment, I decided to enroll in graduate school at the University of Colorado, Boulder in Computer Science.
                    However, during all of my studies, I've never had the chance to learn web development -- not until now.

            <h2>My Web Development Journey</h2>
            
            <h3>Background</h3> 
                <p>
                    Prior to my internship, I had no experience in web development, and came to Seattle expecting there to be 
                    a mix of on the job training as well as guidance from my team members to help me with my project. Although I did
                    get this (to some degree) I couldn't help but feel that there were other, better ways of learning web development, 
                    that would lead to long term understanding and a deepre appreciation for the field. That's why I'm here now. I'm 
                    creating a default web development project from scratch to document my journey and gain the understanding that a 
                    12 week internship couldn't provide. So, without further ado, please join me on my adventure.  
                </p>
