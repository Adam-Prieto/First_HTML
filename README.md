# HTML Project

## Introduction
After a long and eventful internship, I've decided to learn web development the right 
way -- from scratch. Here lies my journey from having only a cursory, high level 
overview of the subject to (hopefully) becoming a completely competent full stack 
engineer.

## Push #1 - A simple update

Just to make sure that I can work with html in VS Code, I want to see if I can push my changes to my GitHub account. I was able to. 

## Push #2 - An update and conslusion to html

I've decided that my html project is up to par and would like to showcase what I've learned thus far. Please find a simple html project in this repo.
