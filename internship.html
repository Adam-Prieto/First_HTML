        <p> From late May to early August 2024, I was fortunate enough to intern with Amazon Photos in Seattle
            where I got the chance to learn front end web development and see how software engineering is handled
            in a professional enviornment. During the summer, I went from having no previous understanding of web 
            development to having a solid foundation in React, JavaScript, TypeScript, and the stages of software
            deployment -- all imperative to an aspiring software engineer. However, with my internship now over, 
            I realize that there are still so many things about web development that a 12 week internship can't 
            cover or introduce, hence this project.  
        </p>
